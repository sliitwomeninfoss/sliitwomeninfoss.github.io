                        <p>
                            The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to
                            ensure that all participants in the SLIIT Women In
                            FOSS community have the best possible experience. We
                            are all here to help each other learn, grow our
                            skill sets, and have a good time! The SLIIT Women In
                            FOSS Community Code of Conduct covers our behavior
                            as members of the SLIIT Women In FOSS community, in
                            any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, code
                            repository, IRC channel, private correspondence, or
                            public meetings. As a worldwide community, diversity
                            is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead
                            to communication issues and unhappiness. To that
                            end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people
                            to adhere to, to ensure that the SLIIT Women In FOSS
                            community continues to be an excellent space in
                            which like-minded individuals are able to
                            communicate, collaborate, and contribute. This isn't
                            an exhaustive list of things that you can't do.
                            Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended
                            — a guide to make it easier to be excellent to one
                            another. We expect it to be followed in spirit as
                            much as in the letter.{' '}

                                affect users and colleagues, and you should take
                                those consequences into account when making
