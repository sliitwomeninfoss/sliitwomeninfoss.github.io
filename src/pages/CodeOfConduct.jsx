                        <p>
                            The purpose of our Community Code of Conduct is to ensure
                            that all participants in the SLIIT Women In FOSS community have the
                            best possible experience. We are all here to help each other
                            learn, grow our skill sets, and have a good time! The SLIIT
                            Women In FOSS Community Code of Conduct covers our behavior as
                            members of the SLIIT Women In FOSS community, in any forum, mailing
                            list, wiki, web site, code repository, IRC channel, private
                            correspondence, or public meetings. As a worldwide
                            community, diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it
                            can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To
                            that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to
                            adhere to, to ensure that the SLIIT Women In FOSS community continues
                            to be an excellent space in which like-minded individuals
                            are able to communicate, collaborate, and contribute. This
                            isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do.
                            Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended â€” a
                            guide to make it easier to be excellent to one another. We
                            expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

                                colleagues, and you should take those consequences into
